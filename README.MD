### Brief intruduction

With a background in geophysics and experience in stock trading, as well as attempted entrepreneurship, 
I have pursued a diverse range of interests throughout their career. 
However, driven by a desire to expand their skillset and explore new challenges, 
I decided to pivot into the world of programming. 
With this in mind, i enrolled in the prestigious App Academy to further their understanding of coding and development. 
I am now eager to apply their unique blend of experience and newly acquired technical skills to make a meaningful impact in the tech industry.
